# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard developed to explore and analyze the landscape of electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., with a focus on identifying trends, adoption patterns, and key performance metrics across states, models, and manufacturers.

# ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The objective is to understand the growth and distribution of electric vehicles (both BEVs â€“ Battery Electric Vehicles and PHEVs â€“ Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) using a dataset of over 1.5 lakh vehicles.
The analysis focuses on:
EV market growth across years ;
Comparison between BEV and PHEV usage;
Manufacturer and model-wise trends;
Regional adoption (state-wise);
CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility and its influence.

# ðŸŽ¯ KPIs Tracked
Total Electric Vehicles â€“ Overall registered EVs in the dataset;
Average Electric Range â€“ To gauge technological improvements;
Total BEV Vehicles â€“ Including % of total EVs;
Total PHEV Vehicles â€“ Including % of total EVs;
CAFV Eligibility â€“ Classification based on environmental incentive eligibility;

# ðŸ§  Key Insights
Tesla accounts for over 50% of total EVs registered;
BEVs dominate the dataset with over 77% share;
The year 2023 shows the highest EV adoption trend;
States like Washington, California, and New York lead in EV registration;
A significant portion of vehicles are CAFV eligible, indicating eco-policy impact;
